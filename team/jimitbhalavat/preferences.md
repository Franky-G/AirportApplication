# Preferences for Jimit Bhalavat

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * It is generally easier to reach me via text and electronic mail. I try to respond within one hour. I am 
     usually available throughout the day. 
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * My expectations is that we will work through the project efficiently and in a timely manner which will allow
     us to finish our semester long project. We will create an inclusive environment and all opinions and suggestions 
     will be welcomed and worked on.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My personal goals are to brush up on my teamwork and communication skills. Working in a team is different than 
     working alone. I will make sure to help people and give my suggestions where I think is appropriate. This will 
     improve my communication skills since we will be engaging with the team members and other poeple in the class.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * The obstacles that we might encounter are conflict and difference of opinion, low engagement with the team might 
     derail us from our team and personal goals. But I would also say that difference of opinion can be healthy and, 
     can trigger useful debates. It can make people think differently; innovation can happen and results flourish.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I would say that grades are important, but trying your best and working at full capacity supersede grades. 
     If the entire team has worked hard and at full capacity, we will receive the grades we deserve. If a few members
     of the team think "B" is acceptable, it is upto them, but it should not affect the amount of hard work they put 
     in the project.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I would say that the work should be distributed equally, and if a team member finishes early they should try to help
     other members in order to reach the goals. If a team member does more work than others, they should definitely 
     receive a higher grade than the others.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I anticipate it will take around 12-15 hours every week in order to make the project successful.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We will make a uniform decision of who does what on projects and activities, and we will make sure we work with 
     each other in order to meet the deadline. We will try to assign equal amount of work to all members.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * We will send out messages before every deadline and meeting time, so team members can make sure they have all the stuff
     ready to meet the goals and deadline. If a team member misses a deadline, we will try to talk with them and make sure that 
     mistake is not repeated. If it happens again, we might talk to the instructor about a workable slution.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We will work together in order to meet all opinions and expectations. We will gather all the opinions before we start 
     working on a project, and we will make project goals accordingly, so it meets everyone's expectations.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * We will try to meet them on a middle ground. Our job is to adapt the style to get the most out of the people around us.
     We will try to put the right person in the right job and set a clear vision for the team. We will try to start understanding 
     different work styles and work accordingly and proficiently. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * We would definitely want to have a standing meeting time outside of class. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I would say they team will need to meet daily for a 15-minute talk where we can discuss our priorities and make sure we are
     on track. And also, we would like to schedule a weekly meeting where we can discuss where things are going right and where 
     they are going wrong. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * We will definitely take approval from all team members before making a decision. 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * We will try to take their opinion, and work towards it. If their opinion isn't agreed by many people on the team, then we
     will try to pursue them that the option on desk is our best move forward.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * We would call on other team members to ask for their thoughts. This will boost their morale and confidence. If the dominating 
     person tries to cut people off when they are talking, we could say that we need input from others as well. 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will communicate with my team members and tell them that I feel most of the responsibilities are falling on me, and then we
     can come with a strategy. Communication is a key part when working together in a team.
