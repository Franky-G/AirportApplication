# Preferences for Kyle Cummings

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * It is easiest to reach me through text, but I will be on my computer a lot so Slack or Discord will work.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect our team to be able to successfully complete every assigned task in a organized way. I expect us to all work together and communicate to complete everything by or before the due date. 
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I would like to become proficient in using GitHub with a team. In general I would like to be able to communicate all necessary project information in an efficient way. 
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Right off the bat I believe we will have some confusion using GitHub. I also think it may take a bit of time to build the chemistry and teamwork we need. But once that is achieved I believe we will be able to work smoothly. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I do not think this is something that needs to be worried about. I think that if each person pulls their weight you get whatever grade you get. But if this actually becomes an issue I think it all comes down to how much work each teammate is willing to put in. Discussing this beforehand will fix this issue. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * No, personally I believe that everyone should do a similar amount of work. Because if there is another person who also wants to do more work to get an A then this leaves little work for the others. It just causes problems. 
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Personally I believe setting time each day to work on a project is a good way to manage this. If we work a minimum of around 2 per day of the week I think it will all turn out well. But it also depends on how the project is going at the time. More or less time could also be valid. 
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We will decide this together as a team. We could figure out what each person wants to do and go from there. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * If this happens we as a team will have to make arrangements to make sure this doesn't happen again and figure out why this didn't happen. This type of thing just needs to be communicated. 
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * If this happens the team will have to find a happy medium of quality where everyone can be happy. But others may have to produce better quality work if need be.  
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * To deal with this I think making meeting times each day of the week will be good to keep everything organized. If we at least discuss project goals about each day to see what everyone is responsible and check in on progress this will work. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes this is a very good idea. Checking in on progress and goals if essential. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I think the team will need to meet around 3 times a week outside of class. But once we get in the roll of things we can adjust this to see how things are going. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Yes if possible each team member should know about major decisions of the project. 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * We will discuss the scenario and work around that. Because the one that disagrees may have a good point. 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Talk as a team about the work distribution and voice opinions. This is what the meeting outside of class will be used for. 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Talk to the group about distributing tasks and assignments in a better way. As well as letting them know how I feel it is going.
