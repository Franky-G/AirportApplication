# Preferences for Jake Barth

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * I am reachable by text (331-442-6539) whenever I'm awake however if you need me to give a lot of detail or information reach me by email. I am constantly monitoring my inbox during the most hours I'm awake but will likely answer slower than by text.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * My expectations are that as we work together we are able to support and keep each other accountable throughout the semester and create an environment where we feel comfortable coming to each other for anything. My hope is that this will allow us to complete our project successfully, efficiently and, correctly. 
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I have limited experience using GitHub so that is certainly something I'd like to gain confidence with. I also haven't worked with a team for a full project so I would like to learn more about how best to work with others. 
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I'll admit these first few GitHub assignments have really tripped me up more than I would've expected and I'd expect that those of us on the team in the same boat as me might cause some conflict in these first few weeks.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Going into a new class I would hope everyone would be setting their expectations for themselves high and be shooting for an "A". However, if a member starts to think a "B" or lower is acceptable I would hope that it would not impact our quality of work as a team; that being said issues will be brought up if necessary.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * No, I think this could cause unnecessary conflict as a team. I also think this is a moral hazard as it would encourage other members to do less work with the expectation it gets done by someone else. I also understand it will be impossible to keep equal workloads but we are all in this together so we can all try and keep workloads equal.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * This will definitely vary week to week however I am expecting to work 10 hours a week at a minimum for this class. I do realize this could definitely double if I or the team run into loads of problems one week. That being said being efficient while working is just as important as long as the quality of our work doesn't deteriorate in favor of working less.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * This is definitely a team decision and we can assign work based on strengths, weaknesses and interests. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * If something like this happens let the team know beforehand, just like you should for classwork in other classes. I understand everyone is busy however, as communication is a large part of this course I feel as little mercy would be given if no heads-up is given but we can work through issues as needed beforehand. If missing things becomes a habit, there should be a team discussion.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * I think that is to be expected and we should all work together to find a middle ground that satisfies all of us. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I think members should be free to work whenever it is convenient for them. That being said we should all try to keep pace with each other each day so none of us are relying on last minute work to do our own parts.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes we should have at least one team meeting outside of class time a week.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I think 1-2 times a week seems like a good place to start however if we end up needing to meet multiple times a day everyday of the week for a tough week that is understandable too. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Yes, we are all responsible for the decisions being made and we all need to understand what goals we are working towards. That being said approval is probably not needed for determining items like whether your loop variable name should be "i" or "j" in your function.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * We should all discuss why this is and deal with it on a case by case basis. It could be that all of us are wrong except for the one member.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * We should bring it up in a discussion and express our opinions to find the middle ground again.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Bring it up with the team and evaluate what situation we are in as well as self checking to see whether my perspective of the situation is correct.
