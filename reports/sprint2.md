## Planned Epics

- v2 protocol: This epic will add supported requests to our config, update request version and add both distance and find types. The distance type will allow the user to obtain the distance between a pair of geographical locations. The find type will allow the user to get a list of geographical locations.
- Where am I?: This epic will carry out tasks that will provide the user to view their current location. It will also allow the user to return to their current location after they have changed their map view.
- Where is?: This epic will focus on tasks that will allow the user to see their location on map using longitude and latitude. It will also allow them to search for a place by typing or pasting a string that provides longitude and latitude.
- Find Distance: The user will have the option to specify two geographical locations using the same or different means and calculate the distance between those two locations. For the user's visualization there will be a line drawn between the two locations on the map.
- Find Places: The user will have the option to search places to visit using names and municipalities around the world and allow the selection of one place to visit from a short list of relevant places.

## Metrics

| Statistic | # Planned | # Completed |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Epics | *5* | *0* |

- The team's ability to complete the planned tasks/story points based on the previous sprint result is beyond sufficent. The team will use integration methods that will allow each memeber to work efficiently and in a timely manner. The team shares a high confidence to perform well during this sprint. Reflection will be done in regards to the retrospective from sprint 1 and the team will make reasonable attempts to complete any changes.
