* The Product Increment release for `v1.0` created on GitHub.
* The completed metrics are captured below.
* The scrums completed during each lecture are captured below.
* The sprint review and restrospective are captured below.
* The design document is updated (design.md).

## Planned Epics

- v1 protocol: Create a way for the user to view server statistics. These will change from server to server depending on which server the user is connected to.
- Team identification: Our team name is tech10. This name will be added to our team's website in the header, footer, as well as the browser tab and "tech10" will be 
the name set for the server and client. 
- About: In this epic, the user will have information on our team members and the team itself. Additionally, the user will be able to see the teams mission statement.
- Where am I?: This epic will carry out tasks that will provide the user to view their current location. It will also allow the user to return to their current location after they have changed their map view.
- Where is?: This epic will focus on tasks that will allow the user to see their location on map using longitude and latitude. It will also allow them to search   for a place by typing or pasting a string that provides longitude and latitude.

## Review

#### Epics done  
 - Team Information : "tech10" is integrated into our website's header, footer, as well as the browser tab. Additionally, "tech10" is there in the server and client.
 - About : Page skeleton created and all member's name, biography, and images integrated. Additionally, team picture and team mission statement are present.
 - v1 protocol: Server configuration information shows after clicking the information icon. Server status icons available to signify whether or not someone is connected to the server. 

#### Epics not done 
 - Where am I?
 - Where is?

#### What went well
- Team was always present when called upon
- We've gotten through most of things we had in mind
- The "About" and "Team Information" epics went smoothly

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
- Showing server configuration information was a bit challenging and we eventually figured it out once talking to TAs
- Importing custom images for server status was confusing. Resolved by formatting custom images to footer instead of replacing current images.
- Massive struggle with geolocation, however we are very close to finishing the "Where am I?" epic.

## Retrospective

#### What went well
- The teams scrum meetings were productive as well as positive
- Initially, the tools and policies necessary for this sprint were a bit daunting to our group, however we adapted and have become comfortable using them

#### Potential improvements
- Showing server configuration information as a separate tab
- After dropping a pin, map should not zoom out unless asked
- Our team synergy, team organization, and team availibility to help other team members was exceptional.

#### What we will change next time
- Having a consistent time to meet, as we were very spontaneous during this sprint
- Coordinate a group calender for Sprint 2
