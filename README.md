# Team Preferences

It is easier to reach the team via text and email. The team is usually up and around on discord
and slack as well. The team's expectations are sense of urgency and help people if they are stuck.
The team also expects to finish the assignments in a timely and in an efficient manner. The team's
personal goals are to brush up on teamwork and communication skills. The team is also ready to 
help other people whenever there is a hiccup, and also want to make sure that we are comfortable with
one another. The team would also like to learn what it is like to work in a real-world setting.

Some conflicts for the team may be our scheduling conflicts. Additionally, the team may be unfamilliar 
with some of the software. We believe that the effort put into our project should supercede the grade 
attached to it. The team has an emphasis on building each other up together as we build our project
up. We will provide equal distribution amongst the team members as best as we can until things 
become apparent that we need a leader, not for a better grade, but for the best product.
