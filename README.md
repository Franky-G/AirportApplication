# Team Preferences

It is easier to reach the team via text and email. The team is usually up and around on discord
and slack as well. The team's expectations are sense of urgency and help people if they are stuck.
The team also expects to finish the assignments in a timely and in an efficient manner. The team's
personal goals are to brush up on teamwork and communication skills. The team is also ready to 
help other people whenever there is a hiccup, and also want to make sure that we are comfortable with
one another. The team would also like to learn what it is like to work in a real-world setting.

Some conflicts for the team may be scheduling conflicts. Additionally, the team may be unfamilliar 
with some of the software. The team believes that the effort put into our project should supercede the grade 
attached to it. The team has an emphasis on building each other up together as the team builds the project
up. The team will provide equal distribution amongst team members as best as possible until things 
become apparent that a leader is required, not for a better grade, but for the best product.

The team estimates that there will be about 75 man hours a week to make the project successful.
The team will divide the work evenly amoung the team members. The team will use our understanding of
each persons skillset and background to make a uniform decision on assigning projects and activities
to teammates. The team will have a contingency plan on the issue, however the team believes that forgiveness
is necessary. The team also believes that they will be around each other enough that they shouldnt have
a problem with commitments.

If the team has different opinions on the quality of work they team can make an compromise toward the average 
of everyones expectations. We will deal with different work habbits by adapting all of our styles in order to 
get more out of each team member. If the team has a plan going into each project each member of the team will 
know what they have to do. The team would like to have meetings outside of class through Discord or MS Teams. 
Whenever the team feels like a meeting needs to happen it will. Oustide of class the team should meet at least 
three times per week. Depending on the scenario the team may need to meet more or less and we can adjust off that.  

The team will make decisions together and uniformly with respect to the project throughout the semester. If conflicts arise 
the team will discuss concerns or problems as necessary. The team should bring it up in a discussion and express opinions to 
find a middle ground again. In the case of concerns with regards to distribution of workloads a team meeting will be 
facilatated to rectify and resolve any issues.
