# Team Preferences

It is easier to reach the team via text and email. The team is usually up and around on discord
and slack as well. The team's expectations are sense of urgency and help people if they are stuck.
The team also expects to finish the assignments in a timely and in an efficient manner. The team's
personal goals are to brush up on teamwork and communication skills. The team is also ready to 
help other people whenever there is a hiccup, and also want to make sure that we are comfortable with
one another. The team would also like to learn what it is like to work in a real-world setting.
